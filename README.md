Title: Evolving towards PostgreSQL

Abstract:

pgBackRest is one of many tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.  These mutualistic projects provide numerous benefits but integrating with PostgreSQL and interfacing with the community can be challenging.

In this talk we'll discuss what is involved in maintaining a project in cooperation with PostgreSQL, what that means for each, and how we can make both better in the process.
