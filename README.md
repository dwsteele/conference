Title: Advanced pgBackRest

Abstract:

pgBackRest implements many advanced features but most of them are disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility, conserve system resources, or to provide a fail-safe default. In this talk we will explore advanced options such as multi-processing, asynchronous archiving, alternate compression types, file bundling, block incremental backup, and delta restore. We will examine the benefits of each feature, when you should enable them, and how they work together to enhance the performance and efficiency of pgBackRest.
