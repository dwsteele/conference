Title: Backup Best Practices with pgBackRest

Abstract:

Backups are a critical part of any enterprise database solution but they are often done poorly or skipped altogether, which can lead to data loss in the event of hardware failure or some other disaster.

In this talk we'll cover database backup best practices and how to implement them with pgBackRest, including:

- WAL archiving and retention
- Backup frequency and retention
- How to meet recovery time/point objectives
- Configuration options
- Performance considerations
